# Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in datasets. It applies unsupervised learning algorithms like Isolation Forest to find outliers.

## Objectives:
- Use unsupervised learning to detect anomalies in transaction data.
- Apply Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Isolation Forest
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Detected anomalies in financial transactions, system logs, or sensor data.
- Implemented unsupervised learning to identify outliers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to detect anomalies in data.
